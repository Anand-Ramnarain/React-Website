      "Twitch Plays Pokémon (TPP) stands as an innovative example of net/web art, showing the relationship between technology, interactivity, and collective creativity. This project started in 2014 where it redefined the boundaries of traditional gaming by using the power of the internet to allow thousands of users to simultaneously control a single game of Pokémon. Through its unique approach, TPP expands the meaning of gaming and evolved into a net/web art form that engages with people on conceptual, aesthetic, and technical levels. This essay aims to examine Twitch Plays Pokémon within the context of net/web art, exploring its innovative use of the internet as a medium for artistic expression.",
      "First, we need to know what Twitch Plays Pokémon is. Twitch Plays Pokémon was when viewers could type commands in a chat box on the Twitch streaming service to control the game Pokémon. Each command was like a vote, and the game would do whatever command got the most votes. It was crazy and chaotic because there were so many people typing commands, the game became a chaotic but fascinating experience. Twitch Plays Pokémon began as an experiment by an anonymous programmer who combined a special program with a Pokémon game emulator. They did this because they wanted to see if they could make a game that thousands of people could play together at the same time.",
      "Now we need to we why Twitch Plays Pokémon is a net/web art. Twitch Plays Pokémon represents net art through its innovative and collaborative approach to gameplay. The project, which allowed thousands of Twitch users to collectively control a single game of Pokémon through chat commands, is an indication of net art as NetSpecific describes 'Net art is an elusive and sometimes anarchic art form which uses the Internet as its primary material' (NetSpecific 2024)this applies to the chaotic yet captivating nature of the Twitch experiment, as it is harnessing the power of the internet and allowing for unpredictable nature of online interactions, Twitch Plays Pokémon uses the internet and Twitch as a canvas for communal expression. Furthermore, NetSpecific discusses how early net artists addressed the best ideals of the internet, which represents Twitch Plays Pokémon as it is used for the collective nostalgia and shared experiences of a generation that knows the Pokémon industry. Additionally, the concept of hacking, cloning, and copying (NetSpecific 2024) in net art highlights the unconventional gameplay mechanics of Twitch Plays Pokémon, where users change the game's mechanics in different ways, challenging traditional gaming conventions. Showing us that Twitch Plays Pokémon is a form of net art by uses the internet as a platform for collective creativity, social interaction, and exploration of digital culture.",
      "Now that we know what it is we can start to analyse it. At its core, Twitch Plays Pokémon challenges the traditional relationship between player and game, as it is changing the dynamics of artistic creation and interactive experience. This is seen as it allows viewers to input commands through Twitch chat to control the game, which therefore also blurs the lines between player and spectator, taking apart the known concepts of authorship and control. This approach to gameplay encourages reflection on agency and the nature of interactive art within digital environments. This is because of what Mailloux explores in 'Convention and Context,' conventions not only shape artistic practices but also reflect shared understandings within communities. (Mailloux 1983) This means that our conventions and standards guide and mirror artistic expression and how people work. This form of collaborative gameplay experience of Twitch Plays Pokémon changes what we know, which highlights the connection between individual thinking and collective consciousness. Just as our conventions establish expectations, Twitch Plays Pokémon goes into an uncharted area of digital collaboration, as it is challenging conventional frameworks and making people reconsider their roles within artistic creation, though is an unconventional approach in its interaction.",
      "Through its use of technology and interactivity, Twitch Plays Pokémon led us to the exploration of the concept of interactive art, offering insights into the evolving relationship between creators, participants, and digital mediums. As it is changing the relationship between artistic creation and engagement. This is seen as before creators had authorship and control over their works, with audiences just being a viewer. However, Twitch Plays Pokémon challenges these changes in our standard by empowering users to actively shape the outcome of the gaming experience through their collective inputs. This shift in agency blurs the distinction between creators and viewers, allowing for a collaborative and different approach to artistic expression.",
      "Moreover, we can see how the project uses digital mediums, particularly Twitch, to allow for real-time interaction and collaboration on a scale. This shows us the transformative power of digital technology in changing artistic processes and making for greater inclusivity within creative communities. As users engage with the project through the digital interface, they not only contribute to the creation of art but also become an important part of the artistic experience. In this way, Twitch Plays Pokémon highlights the evolving role of digital mediums in shaping collaborative artistic works and changing the relationship between creators and users. By using the power of technology to allow collective creativity and interaction, we can see how it offers insights into the potential of digital platforms to change what we know about artistic expression and allow for meaningful engagement.",
      "Another aspect we can investigate is from an aesthetic standpoint. This is because Twitch Plays Pokémon presents a dynamic visual through its unpredictability. This is seen as there were a lot of commands from the comment which resulted in unreliable gameplay, which led to chaos, frustration, and unexpected wins. This chaotic yet fascinating gameplay of the project is seen by Nathalie Lawhead's reflection on Flash's impact on digital aesthetics: 'Flash let us dream what we wanted the internet to look like.'( McNamara 2020) This highlights the transformative potential of technology to shape artistic expression, showing us how the aesthetic controlled by randomness not only challenges the standard we have for game design but also evokes some emotion in the art’s work.",
      "Furthermore, through its chaotic and unpredictable gameplay, we can see how the use of users’ comments not only forms a narrative but also creates a digital collage, a piece of artwork created by the use of digital tools expressing the artist's style and intention, (McNamara 2020) which aligns with Lawhead's work as it is highlighting how different inputs can form a narrative, challenging our know standards of game design. Through its visuals, emotional gameplay, and elements of controlled randomness, Twitch Plays Pokémon passes traditional gaming aesthetics, offering viewers a unique immersive and emotional artistic experience. We can also analyse it from a technical perspective, as Twitch Plays Pokémon represents the use of technology to allow for collective interaction and collaboration, like the open-source tools discussed in Rea McNamara's article on Flash's legacy. (McNamara 2020) The project's integration of Twitch's chat with an emulator of the game interface represents a groundbreaking feature, which allowed for real-time communication and coordination among thousands of participants to control the game. The insight into preserving Flash-based works highlights the technical requirement for this project, as it emphasises the importance of open-source tools like Conifer in digital preservation. (McNamara 2020) This is seen in how Twitch Plays Pokémon shows the development of custom scripts and algorithms to interpret user commands to allow for real-time gameplay, showing its technical strengths. Through its use of Twitch and software tools, while also allowing it to transform the internet into an interactive artistic medium, changing the possibilities of digital collaboration and expression.",
      "Furthermore, we can investigate how broader implications Twitch Plays Pokemon has on net/web art and digital culture.  Since it is one of the earliest net/web arts which uses large-scale, crowd-sourced gameplay, Twitch Plays Pokémon has inspired many projects and experiments just like, Twitch Plays Street Fighter or Twitch Plays Dark Souls, that explores the intersection of gaming, technology, and collective creativity. This project's approach to collaborative gameplay has sparked conversations and explorations across artistic communities, which is pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the digital realm of digital. This was highlighted in Mailloux's exploration of conventions and context, where he discusses how conventions not only shape artistic practices but also reflect shared understandings within communities. The unconventional approach of Twitch Plays Pokémon challenges known frameworks and makes people want to reconsider their roles within artistic creation, and the changing power of the internet to allow for more creative collaborations.",
      "Furthermore, we can see how Twitch Plays Pokémon wants to change the potential of the internet, as we can see how online communities can collaborate to create art in different ways. As it allowed thousands of users from around the world to control the game, it highlights the transformative power of digital platforms by allowing for immersive and collaborative artistic experiences. This again highlights Lawhead's reflection on Flash's impact on digital aesthetics, where Flash was seen as a tool that allowed users to shape their own digital experiences. (McNamara 2020) This is the same as Twitch Plays Pokémon as it empowers users to actively contribute to the creation of art, blurring the lines between creators and viewers, while allowing for a sense of shared ownership over the artistic process. Showing how this project has the potential to change artistic expression and shape new boundaries of creative collaboration in the digital realm.",
      "Moreover, we can see how Twitch Plays Pokémon show the importance of being net/web art, as it uses Twitch challenges and changes artistic expression. As the project continues to inspire new generations of artists, and gamers. It serves as a reminder of the endless possibilities of collective imagination and the power of technology has people around the world. Just as Twitch Plays Pokémon has left a mark on what net/web art is, it also means to me, that Pokémon was one of the first games that got me interested in gaming and wanting to develop my games and applications. Just seeing the collaborative and creative projects of Twitch Plays Pokémon inspired me to create interactive experiences that not only entertain but also bring people together, this just shows the power it has. We can now see how Twitch Plays Pokémon serves as both a tribute to gaming and to create meaningful and immersive digital experiences, showing how it has changed our idea for using the internet as a medium for artistic expression and experiences.",
      "In conclusion, our examination of Twitch Plays Pokémon reveals its impact as an example of net/web art, fundamentally reshaping what we know of interactive digital experiences. By harnessing the collective creativity of thousands of users through real-time interaction on platforms like Twitch, the project challenges conventional standards of authorship and control, blurring the boundaries between creators and spectators. As we've explored its conceptual, aesthetic, and technical dimensions, it becomes evident that Twitch Plays Pokémon not only serves as a reflection of the transformative power of technology but also as a spark for changing the possibilities of collaborative artistic expression in the digital age. Twitch Plays Pokémon stands as a testament to the impact of innovative projects on shaping the future of artistic expression in the digital realm.",
